### Overview

[Protected Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en) provides the most
comprehensive data for conservation areas worldwide. Specifically, it
provides the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and the World
Database on Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (WDOECM).
These databases are used to monitor the performance of existing
protected areas, and identify priority areas for future conservation
efforts. Additionally, these databases receive monthly updates from
government agencies and non-governmental organizations. However, they
are associated with [several issues that need to be addressed prior to
analysis](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/calculating-protected-area-coverage)
and the dynamic nature of these databases means that the entire data
cleaning process needs to be repeated after obtaining a new version.

The *wdpar R* package provides an interface to data provided by
[Protected Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en). Specifically,
the package can automatically obtain data from the [World Database on
Protected Areas
(WDPA)](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA)
and the [World Database on Other Effective Area-Based Conservation
Measures
(WDOECM)](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/oecms). It
also provides methods for cleaning data from these databases following
best practices (outlined in [Butchart *et al.*
2015](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12158); [Protected Planet
2021](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/calculating-protected-area-coverage);
[Runge *et al.* 2015](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac9180)). The
main functions are `wdpa_fetch()` for downloading data and
`wdpa_clean()` for cleaning data. For more information, please see the
package vignette.

### Installation

#### Package installation

The [latest official version of the *wdpar R*
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wdpar) can be installed
using the following R code. Please note that this package requires the
[*curl*](https://github.com/jeroen/curl) and [*sf
R*](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) packages which may require
additional software to be installed. If you encounter problems
installing the *wdpar R* package, please consult the installation
instructions for these packages.

``` r
install.packages("wdpar", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

Alternatively, the latest developmental version can be installed using
the following *R* code. Please note that while developmental versions
may contain additional features not present in the official version,
they may also contain coding errors.

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("prioritizr/wdpar")
```

#### Additional dependencies

The *wdpar R* package can leverage the *prepr R* package to augment data
cleaning procedures. Since the *prepr R* package is not available on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network, it is listed as an optional dependency.
In some cases, the *prepr R* package is required to complete the data
cleaning procedures (e.g. to fix especially extreme geometry issues) and
the *wdpar R* package will throw an error if the package is not
available. To install the *prepr R* package, please use the following R
code.

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("prioritizr/prepr")
```

Note that the *prepr R* package has system dependencies that need to be
installed before the package itself can be installed (see below for
platform-specific instructions).

##### *Windows*

A Chromium-based web browser to be installed (e.g., Google Chrome,
Chromium, Brave). Also, the
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) software needs
to be installed to install the *prepr R* package package from source.
This software provides system requirements from
[rwinlib](https://github.com/rwinlib/).

##### *Ubuntu*

A Chromium-based web browser must to be installed (e.g., Google Chrome,
Chromium, Brave). Also, the `gmp`, `mpfr`, and several spatial libraries
need to be installed. For recent versions of Ubuntu (18.04 and later),
these libraries are available through official repositories. They can be
installed using the following system commands:

    apt-get -y update
    apt-get install -y libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev chromium-browser

##### *Linux*

For Unix-alikes, a Chromium-based web browser (e.g., Google Chrome,
Chromium, Brave), `gmp` (\>= 4.2.3), `mpfr` (\>= 3.0.0), and `gdal` (\>=
3.2.2) are required.

##### *macOS*

A Chromium-based web browser to be installed (e.g., Google Chrome,
Chromium, Brave). Also, the `gmp`, `mpfr`, and `gdal` libraries are
required. The easiest way to install these libraries is using
[HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/). After installing HomeBrew, these libraries
can be installed using the following commands in the system terminal:

    brew install pkg-config
    brew install gmp
    brew install mpfr
    brew install gdal
    brew install --cask chromium

### Usage

Here we will provide a short introduction to the *wdpar R* package.
First, we will load the *wdpar R* package. We will also load the *dplyr*
and *ggmap R* packages to help explore the data.

``` r
# load packages
library(wdpar)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)
```

Now we will download protected area data for Malta from [Protected
Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en). We can achieve this by
specifying Malta’s country name (i.e. `"Malta"`) or Malta’s [ISO3
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) (i.e. `"MLT"`).
Since data are downloaded to a temporary directory by default, we will
specify that the data should be downloaded to a persistent directory.
This means that R won’t have to re-download the same dataset every time
we restart our R session, and R can simply re-load previously downloaded
datasets as needed.

``` r
# download protected area data for Malta
mlt_raw_pa_data <- wdpa_fetch("Malta", wait = TRUE,
                              download_dir = rappdirs::user_data_dir("wdpar"))
```

Next, we will clean the data set. Briefly, the cleaning steps include:
excluding protected areas that are not yet implemented, excluding
protected areas with limited conservation value, replacing missing data
codes (e.g. `"0"`) with missing data values (i.e. `NA`), replacing
protected areas represented as points with circular protected areas that
correspond to their reported extent, repairing any topological issues
with the geometries, and erasing overlapping areas. For more
information, see `?wdpa_clean`.

``` r
# clean Malta data
mlt_pa_data <- wdpa_clean(mlt_raw_pa_data)
```

Print preview of the data associated with each protected area.

``` r
# print preview
head(mlt_pa_data)
```

Finally, after cleaning the data, let’s plot a map showing Malta’s
protected areas and color each area according to its management category
([as defined by the The International Union for Conservation of
Nature](https://iucn.org/)).

``` r
# reproject data to longitude/latitude for plotting
mlt_pa_data <- st_transform(mlt_pa_data, 4326)

# download basemap imagery
bg <- get_stadiamap(
  unname(st_bbox(mlt_pa_data)), zoom = 8,
  maptype = "stamen_terrain_background", force = TRUE
)

# make map
ggmap(bg) +
geom_sf(aes(fill = IUCN_CAT), data = mlt_pa_data, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
theme(axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-readme-map-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you need to calculate protected area coverage statistics for a
country, please note that you will need to manually clip the cleaned
protected area data to the countries’ coastline and its Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) to obtain accurate results (see [official data
cleaning
guidelines](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/calculating-protected-area-coverage)).
This step is not performed by the *wdpar R* package because there is no
single “best” coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) dataset, since
the “best” dataset for any given project depends on the level of
required precision and available computational resources. For more
examples—including an example of clipping the cleaned data to a
coastline—please refer to the [package
vignette](https://prioritizr.github.io/wdpar/articles/wdpar.html).
